Tooltip shows up when user mouses over a point and disappears when user moves their mouse away. Tool tip should include the correct country, year, life expectancy, fertility, and population data for the data point.

Points are sized proportionally to their corresponding population. It is easy to distinguish a large country from a small country by the size of their points (i.e. China vs. France). Refer to lab 4 for an example.

Points are plotted on the correct corresponding SVG coordinates (scaled correctly). Axes labels and plot title make sense.

There exists a drop down with options to filter data by years. Drop down correctly plots the data for the corresponding year on the plot. All years are displayed correctly.
